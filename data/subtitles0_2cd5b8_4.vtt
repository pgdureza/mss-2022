Now let's take a look at the Movement Process 

00:02.079 --> 00:04.537
from the point-of-view of Operations Personnel.

00:05.286 --> 00:08.393
The movement process begins when Migrants from all over the world

00:08.512 --> 00:10.512
would require travel assistance from IOM.

00:11.744 --> 00:15.079
Operations Personnel would assist in preparing the necessary documents

00:15.215 --> 00:17.215
prior to booking the tickets for the migrants.

00:18.333 --> 00:22.050
Once everything is set, the Ops Personnel books a ticket for the migrants

00:22.141 --> 00:24.599
by communicating with IOM's Airlines Partners.

00:25.436 --> 00:28.847
The proflight number, passenger information, and travel details

00:29.041 --> 00:31.041
are given to the Airlines Partners 

00:31.501 --> 00:35.199
and once everything is done and verified, a ticket is issued accordingly.

00:35.832 --> 00:39.892
The ticket contains all the necessary information regarding fares & taxes.

00:40.844 --> 00:43.130
With all of these information on hand, the Ops Personnel 

00:43.533 --> 00:46.296
would then input all the data into iGATOR.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.172
And once it is time for the Migrants to depart, 

00:49.499 --> 00:51.824
the TOR is set to USED

00:52.667 --> 00:54.667
 the Movement Process is now complete.

00:55.668 --> 00:59.156
So where was MSS in all of this? Let's take a look.
