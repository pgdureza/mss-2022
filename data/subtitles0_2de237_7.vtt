00:00.000 --> 00:03.070
Now let's see the Invoicing Process from the point of view 

00:03.071 --> 00:05.567
of the Airlines Invoice Settlement Team.

00:06.912 --> 00:09.217
We already know that other than issuing tickets,

00:09.412 --> 00:12.919
the Airlines Partners also issue invoices to AIS.

00:13.683 --> 00:16.713
These invoices contain information on the Proflight

00:17.145 --> 00:21.415
the passengers, the itinerary, and the fares & taxes.

00:22.040 --> 00:25.680
As previously mentioned, once the invoices are settled,

00:25.839 --> 00:27.839
the Airlines can be paid. 

00:28.110 --> 00:32.209
However, this is an oversimplification of the invoicing process.

00:32.613 --> 00:34.785
Before payment can actually proceed, 

00:35.078 --> 00:38.814
certain checks and verification must be done, in order to do so.

00:39.942 --> 00:45.184
Furthermore, AIS utilizes an accounting tool provided by IOM.

00:45.709 --> 00:47.556
This tool is known as PRISM;

00:47.713 --> 00:51.124
many of you may have already heard of PRISM yet may not quite understand 

00:51.298 --> 00:55.568
that it provides in relation to the movement process. 

00:56.084 --> 00:59.495
The next few explanations will show you exactly that.

01:00.175 --> 01:06.562
For AIS, PRISM serves as the data entry for the invoices that need to be paid.

01:07.152 --> 01:10.125
However, in order to proceed with processing, 

01:10.318 --> 01:14.779
PRISM requires the ff. information to be verified and checked within the system. 

01:15.293 --> 01:18.514
If this set of information seems familiar to you,

01:18.596 --> 01:23.190
it is because these are the very same information that is contained in the Invoice.

01:23.837 --> 01:28.565
However, this still is not enough in order to proceed with processing the invoice.

01:29.136 --> 01:32.891
Ultimately, AIS must check and verify the information 

01:32.942 --> 01:35.896
in the invoice against information within IOM. 

01:36.493 --> 01:39.333
The document we use to verify the invoice information 

01:39.454 --> 01:41.893
is called the Purchase Order or PO. 

01:43.230 --> 01:46.718
Let's take a closer look at the PO, before we proceed.

01:47.413 --> 01:50.081
The purchase order is a document found in PRISM 

01:50.207 --> 01:54.992
which also shows proflight, passenger, itinerary, and fare details. 

01:55.605 --> 01:58.496
Processing and payment of invoices cannot be done 

01:58.497 --> 02:01.096
unless the PO document exists in PRISM.

02:01.768 --> 02:05.015
A Purchase Order always has a 10-digit document number 

02:05.187 --> 02:07.187
that starts with 4420. 

02:07.846 --> 02:09.846
Again, if this seems familiar,

02:10.136 --> 02:12.747
that is because ticket orders from iGATOR, 

02:12.904 --> 02:17.994
 also come with the same numbering system. Let's investigate further.
