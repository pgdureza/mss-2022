00:00.000 --> 00:03.451
Next, let's see how amendments affect the invoicing process. 

00:03.451 --> 00:07.695
Specifically, let's take a look at rebookings and cancelations. 

00:08.597 --> 00:11.892
Let's go back and look at the overview of the invoicing process again. 

00:13.133 --> 00:15.686
In this scenario, the invoice was already processed

00:15.686 --> 00:17.323
 and payment was already done. 

00:17.966 --> 00:20.316
Let's assume that after the initial invoice was paid,

00:20.504 --> 00:22.504
a rebooking on the ticket was done. 

00:23.213 --> 00:27.038
Under normal circumstances, the rebooking would incur a rebooking fee.

00:28.202 --> 00:32.142
In turn, the Airlines Partners will bill IOM again for the extra fees. 

00:32.731 --> 00:34.909
And once again, this billing will be in the form 

00:34.909 --> 00:38.119
of Invoices which are to be sent directly to AIS.

00:39.669 --> 00:43.684
AIS will then process the Invoice containing the Rebooking Fee in PRISM. 

00:44.442 --> 00:47.167
Yet, hold on a minute, there seems to be a problem. 

00:48.000 --> 00:51.009
Unfortunately, at this point, AIS will not be able

00:51.009 --> 00:53.377
 to process the Invoice for the rebooking fees. 

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
This is because the Purchase Order in PRISM currently doesn't have 

00:57.000 --> 01:00.772
information regarding the rebooking fees amendment. 

01:00.987 --> 01:03.377
In order to update the Purchase Order information, 

01:03.584 --> 01:06.639
action must first be done on the operations side of the process.

01:07.476 --> 01:10.872
The operations personnel would take the rebooking information to iGATOR 

01:10.872 --> 01:12.780
in order to update and amend the TOR. 

01:13.954 --> 01:16.418
Amending the TOR would also consequently update 

01:16.418 --> 01:18.793
the Purchase Order in PRISM, automatically. 

01:20.163 --> 01:24.257
With the purchase order finally update, AIS now has authorization 

01:24.257 --> 01:26.502
to go ahead with processing the rebooking fee. 

01:28.371 --> 01:31.155
With the invoice processed in PRISM by AIS, 

01:31.500 --> 01:33.101
treasury can go ahead with the payment. 

01:35.720 --> 01:38.620
Now let's see what happens if a ticket is cancelled instead.

01:39.591 --> 01:43.519
When a ticket is cancelled, the very first difference is that instead of an Invoice,

01:43.669 --> 01:45.629
the Airlines sends a Credit Note instead. 

01:46.310 --> 01:49.185
On the operations' side, the OPS personnel would also 

01:49.185 --> 01:52.640
update the iGATOR information to include the cancellation amendment.

01:53.510 --> 01:57.540
Following this, the Purchase Order in PRISM will also be updated automatically 

01:57.540 --> 01:59.634
to also include the refund amendment. 

02:00.273 --> 02:02.273
With the Credit Note on hand and the Purchase Order 

02:02.393 --> 02:04.393
updated with the refund amendment,

02:04.617 --> 02:07.892
AIS will then proceed with processing the documents in PRISM.

02:09.518 --> 02:13.108
However, since this is a credit note, does this mean that the initial payment

02:13.108 --> 02:16.023
 we did for the invoice be returned to us by the Airlines? 

02:16.806 --> 02:19.916
No, not at all. Here's what happens instead.

02:21.639 --> 02:25.364
First, it is important to understand that Treasury also uses PRISM 

02:25.364 --> 02:27.364
to transact with the Airlines Partners. 

02:28.202 --> 02:31.351
Specifically, whatever invoices are processed by AIS 

02:31.351 --> 02:33.351
will reflect in the records of Treasury.

02:34.174 --> 02:36.174
And whenever treasury schedules a remittance, 

02:36.439 --> 02:39.144
all invoices within their records will be paid accordingly. 

02:39.951 --> 02:42.036
This is normally done via Bank Transfer.

02:43.739 --> 02:46.684
Going back, how about when Credit Notes are processed? 

02:47.968 --> 02:50.428
When credit notes are processed by AIS, 

02:50.751 --> 02:54.171
the Treasury records are also updated to show the credit note balances. 

02:54.993 --> 02:57.634
However, Treasury cannot remit this to the airlines

02:57.634 --> 03:01.409
because technically, the Airlines owes IOM for these refunds.

03:02.238 --> 03:04.315
What happens instead is that the credit balance 

03:04.575 --> 03:06.575
is deducted from future invoice payments. 

03:07.405 --> 03:10.785
The balance of credit notes will reduce the total balance of invoices.

03:11.510 --> 03:15.325
Then, the remaining invoice balance will be remitted to the Airlines accordingly.
