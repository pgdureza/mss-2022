00:00.890 --> 00:03.840
Now that we have a good understanding of the invoicing process, 

00:04.157 --> 00:06.968
we can proceed with understanding the basic financial impact 

00:06.968 --> 00:09.213
of our actions involved in the movement process.

00:09.884 --> 00:13.414
Letâ€™s take a closer look at Project Codes and Project Budget Lines.

00:14.037 --> 00:16.037
This is an example of a Project Code.

00:16.614 --> 00:20.214
The first two letters of the Project Code denote the type of project this is. 

00:21.094 --> 00:24.128
For movement operations, the most common types of projects are

00:24.148 --> 00:27.874
 Resettlement, Return, Repatriation, Countertrafficking, 

00:28.163 --> 00:32.098
Self-Payers, Facilitated Migration, and Operational Support.

00:32.812 --> 00:35.588
The last four numbers are added to the first two letters 

00:35.588 --> 00:37.866
as a unique identifier for each project type.

00:38.619 --> 00:42.014
The Project Code can then be further subdivided into categories. 

00:42.466 --> 00:47.364
The next string of characters denotes the IOM Mission this specific category is assigned to. 

00:48.014 --> 00:51.982
In this case, EG10 refers to IOM Cairo in Egypt. 

00:53.633 --> 00:56.850
The next two numbers denote the type of costs that are being incurred. 

00:57.371 --> 01:00.081
The most common types are International Staff Costs, 

01:00.451 --> 01:04.341
Local Staff Costs, Office Costs, and Movement Operations Costs.

01:05.653 --> 01:09.428
Finally, the last remaining string of numbers are a unique identifier 

01:09.428 --> 01:12.639
to denote the exact type of specific expense being incurred. 

01:13.346 --> 01:17.881
For movement operations, the most common string is 04.001 

01:18.137 --> 01:20.577
which corresponds to Transport Assistance costs.

01:21.338 --> 01:23.641
All in all, this long string of characters 

01:23.641 --> 01:25.636
is what we refer to as the Project Budget Line. 

01:26.410 --> 01:29.523
The Project Budget Line is also more commonly referred to as 

01:29.523 --> 01:31.773
the Work Budget Structure or the WBS.

01:32.545 --> 01:34.545
The WBS is very important. 

01:34.943 --> 01:38.415
In relation to the project budget, the WBS serves as a way

01:38.415 --> 01:41.220
 for movements to use part of the allocated budget. 

01:44.916 --> 01:48.731
The usage of these WBS lines is charged as costs to the project.

01:49.349 --> 01:53.059
We will discuss this process in more detail in the next few sections.
