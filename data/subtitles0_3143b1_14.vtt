WEBVTT - Made with VTT Creator

00:01.999 --> 00:04.497
For operations personnel, there should only be 

00:04.497 --> 00:06.817
one way to affect the project WBS. 

00:07.626 --> 00:09.816
This is through creating TORs in iGATOR.

00:10.614 --> 00:13.449
Do recall that in order to create the TOR in iGATOR, 

00:13.546 --> 00:15.546
the following information must be provided. 

00:16.416 --> 00:18.416
However, in addition to this information, 

00:18.700 --> 00:21.600
it should also be noted that in order to proceed with TOR creation, 

00:21.851 --> 00:25.271
a WBS must also be provided by the operations personnel.

00:25.970 --> 00:28.475
As we can recall, when a TOR is created, 

00:28.635 --> 00:31.570
a corresponding Purchase Order is also created in PRISM.

00:32.194 --> 00:35.074
As seen here, the WBS information from the TOR 

00:35.074 --> 00:37.074
is also carried over to the Purchase Order.

00:38.154 --> 00:41.159
The Purchase Order will then automatically be integrated into PRISM.

00:41.718 --> 00:44.751
It is important to understand that PRISM holds all the functions 

00:44.751 --> 00:46.246
pertaining to the Project Code. 

00:47.084 --> 00:49.084
Although for operations personnel, the two most important aspects 

00:50.444 --> 00:52.711
are COMMITMENTS and PROJECT COSTS.

00:52.983 --> 00:54.873
Commitments are allocated obligations 

00:54.873 --> 00:57.700
to charge future project costs on the Project balance. 

00:58.491 --> 01:01.204
A simpler way to consider is that commitments do not affect

01:01.204 --> 01:04.999
 the project balance while project costs directly reduce the Project Balance.

01:05.827 --> 01:08.710
Further still, all commitments will become project costs 

01:08.710 --> 01:10.430
as certain scenarios are triggered.

01:11.132 --> 01:13.352
So going back, when a TOR has been created in iGATOR 

01:14.197 --> 01:17.357
and its corresponding PO has also been created in PRISM,

01:18.242 --> 01:22.272
the WBS that was transferred automatically goes into PROJECT COMMITMENTS.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.873
If we look back at iGATOR, it should be noted that 

01:26.873 --> 01:29.623
the newly created TOR is still in the “ISSUED” status. 

01:30.393 --> 01:32.773
What happens then when the TOR is set to “USED”?

01:34.697 --> 01:39.052
When the TOR is set to “USED”, the commitments become Project Costs. 

01:39.692 --> 01:43.167
And these project costs are instantly deducted from the Project Balance.

01:44.680 --> 01:48.530
At this point, the WBS is charged as an EXPENSE accounting entry. 

01:49.273 --> 01:51.724
For movement operations, these expense accounts 

01:51.724 --> 01:56.409
are normally Air Travel Costs, Staff Travel Costs, or Unrecoverable Costs. 

01:57.137 --> 02:00.213
Unrecoverable costs are mostly comprised of penalties 

02:00.213 --> 02:02.213
or non-refundable fares & taxes.
