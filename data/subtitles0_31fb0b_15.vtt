00:00.199 --> 00:04.634
As previously mentioned, TORs can be amended to make further changes.

00:05.362 --> 00:07.531
 The two most common types of amendments 

00:07.531 --> 00:09.886
are rebooking and cancellation amendments.

00:10.583 --> 00:14.383
In order to do amendments, the TOR status must still be “ISSUED”. 

00:14.986 --> 00:18.566
In this example, the TOR has already been set to “USED” 

00:18.763 --> 00:22.658
and the corresponding WBS has already been charged to the project.

00:23.354 --> 00:25.354
With the help of AIS, 

00:25.395 --> 00:29.035
the iGATOR status can be reverted back from “USED” to “ISSUED”.

00:29.726 --> 00:33.139
The immediate financial effect of this action is a transfer

00:33.139 --> 00:35.139
 from PROJECT COSTS to COMMITMENTS. 

00:35.705 --> 00:39.902
In a sense, this effect removes the expenses charged to the Project 

00:39.902 --> 00:42.632
and this effectively replenishes the project balance.

00:43.394 --> 00:46.374
The main reason why a TOR is reverted back to “Issued” 

00:46.374 --> 00:49.499
is to allow TOR amendments to be done by Ops personnel.

00:50.214 --> 00:53.814
Say for example, a rebooking amendment was done on the TOR. 

00:54.581 --> 00:55.986
When a TOR is rebooked, 

00:56.164 --> 00:59.399
additional costs are incurred in the form of rebooking fees. 

01:00.041 --> 01:02.828
These rebooking fees are recognized in the form of 

01:02.828 --> 01:05.603
additional commitments since the TOR is still “Issued”.

01:06.378 --> 01:09.075
It goes to follow that additional rebooking amendments

01:09.075 --> 01:11.930
 will continuously add more charges to commitments.

01:13.530 --> 01:16.390
When the amended TOR will be finally set to “USED”, 

01:16.795 --> 01:19.202
all of these additional commitments will transfer

01:19.202 --> 01:21.707
 to Project Costs as additional expenses. 

01:22.413 --> 01:25.531
The project costs now include the original fare charges

01:25.531 --> 01:27.841
 plus all the rebooking amendment fees. 

01:28.570 --> 01:31.830
All of these charges will be deducted from the Project Balance.

01:33.306 --> 01:37.341
The other amendment type, cancellations, works a bit differently. 

01:37.777 --> 01:40.692
There are mainly three types of cancellation amendments; 

01:41.019 --> 01:44.284
UNUSED FULL REFUND, UNUSED PARTIAL REFUND, 

01:44.297 --> 01:45.972
and USED PARTIAL REFUND.

01:46.667 --> 01:49.536
UNUSED FULL REFUND amendments are instances 

01:49.536 --> 01:54.041
where the initial invoice charged to IOM was fully refunded without penalties. 

01:54.751 --> 01:59.243
In this regard, the effect of this amendment in iGATOR is that the status 

01:59.243 --> 02:01.243
is changed from ISSUED to “CANCELLED”.

02:01.742 --> 02:06.000
In turn, the effect of this in PRISM is that the current existing commitments 

02:06.000 --> 02:10.365
from this TOR are effectively written-off and removed entirely from the Project. 

02:11.074 --> 02:15.552
In effect, a full cancellation refund amendment has a net ZERO EFFECT 

02:15.552 --> 02:20.077
on the project balance; it neither increases nor decreases the project.

02:21.573 --> 02:23.573
Similarly UNUSED PARTIAL REFUND amendments also change

02:24.948 --> 02:27.583
 the TOR status from “ISSUED” to “CANCELLED”. 

02:28.237 --> 02:32.729
However, the main difference is that unlike FULLY REFUNDABLE amendments, 

02:32.729 --> 02:36.519
PARTIAL REFUNDS cannot remove all the commitments present in PRISM.

02:37.162 --> 02:40.817
This remaining amount is actually the penalty fee for the cancellation. 

02:41.224 --> 02:43.744
And this amount automatically goes directly 

02:43.774 --> 02:46.599
into the Project Costs as unrecoverable expenses. 

02:47.347 --> 02:50.782
This has the overall effect of decreasing the project balance.

02:53.323 --> 02:55.543
And for the last cancellation amendment,

02:55.797 --> 03:00.102
 let us see how USED PARTIAL REFUND affects the Project WBS. 

03:00.776 --> 03:03.591
Unlike the two previous cancellation amendments, 

03:03.739 --> 03:06.707
USED PARTIAL REFUND results in the TOR status 

03:06.707 --> 03:09.462
being updated to “USED” instead of “CANCELLED”. 

03:10.161 --> 03:13.774
An example of when this amendment type is done is for situations 

03:13.774 --> 03:16.619
where only a portion of the flight leg has been cancelled 

03:16.875 --> 03:19.325
while the rest of the flight was used up accordingly.

03:19.970 --> 03:23.125
When the TOR is updated with this cancellation amendment, 

03:23.354 --> 03:26.284
the TOR status will automatically change to “USED” 

03:26.505 --> 03:28.935
and the commitments in PRISM will automatically 

03:28.935 --> 03:32.175
be reduced by the same amount of the cancelled portion of the flight.

03:32.843 --> 03:36.443
However, unlike UNUSED PARTIAL REFUND amendment, 

03:36.757 --> 03:40.967
the remaining balance in PRISM is actually no longer composed of penalty fees. 

03:41.643 --> 03:45.858
These will instead be charged into the project costs as normal expenses 

03:45.858 --> 03:49.143
such as Air Transportation Costs or Staff Travel Costs.
