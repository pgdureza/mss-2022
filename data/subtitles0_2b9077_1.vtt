00:00.202 --> 00:03.945
There are around more than 7 billion people in the world today.

00:04.465 --> 00:06.809
And for each 29 persons,

00:06.869 --> 00:09.747
statistically, one is a MIGRANT

00:10.349 --> 00:15.645
This would mean that 3.5% of the world's population are Migrants.

00:16.245 --> 00:18.808
And as IOM Operations Personnel

00:18.912 --> 00:22.600
providing support to migrants is of utmost importance.

00:23.100 --> 00:27.243
Each of you are familiar with the intricate processes and logistics involved

00:27.268 --> 00:30.245
in the humane and orderly migration of Migrants. 

00:30.907 --> 00:32.282
But in this training,

00:32.312 --> 00:34.578
we'll be focusing more on the processes that occur

00:34.596 --> 00:37.502
behind the operations and logistics.

00:38.019 --> 00:41.644
Specifically, we'll be looking at the Systems involved,

00:41.731 --> 00:43.559
the important reports,

00:43.646 --> 00:48.302
and the financial impact of your actions as IOM Operations Personnel.

00:48.823 --> 00:51.769
This is the Movements Systems Support.
