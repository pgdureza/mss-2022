00:00.230 --> 00:05.590
The movements systems support, or MSS, supports IOM's global objective

00:05.601 --> 00:09.786
 in promoting humane and orderly migration for the benefit of everyone.

00:10.384 --> 00:16.046
MSS reports directly to the Resettlement & Movement Management in IOM HQ. 

00:16.417 --> 00:22.156
Specifically, MSS is directly under the Movement Operations unit of RMM. 

00:22.436 --> 00:25.600
MSS has two further specialized teams in the form of 

00:25.717 --> 00:31.761
Airlines Invoice Settlement (or AIS) and Data Monitoring Section (or DMS).

00:32.368 --> 00:36.523
The main objective of MSS is to support IOM's global objectives 

00:36.605 --> 00:40.551
 in promoting human and orderly migration for the benefit of everyone.

00:40.984 --> 00:43.881
And MSS does this in three main ways 

00:44.152 --> 00:47.831
One is by processing of global airlines invoices,

00:48.103 --> 00:51.286
Another is by monitoring & reporting of movements

00:51.572 --> 00:55.020
and lastly, by providing technical systems support.

00:56.884 --> 00:59.647
Geographically, MSS is physically situated

00:59.759 --> 01:02.865
 in the Manila Administrative Center, in the Philippines. 

01:03.613 --> 01:06.777
Here, MSS frequently interacts with IOM's  

01:06.875 --> 01:09.562
Global Airlines Partners all around the world.

01:10.447 --> 01:15.327
Mainly, these interactions are either related to Invoices or to Credit Notes.

01:15.855 --> 01:18.618
These will be discussed in more detail later.

01:19.651 --> 01:25.046
At the same time, IOM Missions from all over the world also interact with MSS. 

01:25.657 --> 01:29.221
These interactions are mostly related to Ticket Order Records

01:29.374 --> 01:33.339
Statistics & Numbers, User Accesses to RMM Systems, 

01:33.488 --> 01:36.861
and maintenance of the RMM Portal & RMM Systems.

01:37.421 --> 01:41.576
MSS functions can be classified into the three main aspects:

01:42.096 --> 01:47.186
Systems Support, Data Monitoring, and Airline Invoice Settlement.

01:48.204 --> 01:50.204
The Systems support team manages the 

01:50.283 --> 01:53.503
RMM portal and the handbook of international tariffs. 

01:54.147 --> 01:59.104
The team also keeps track of user accesses for iGATOR and other Systems.

01:59.507 --> 02:02.633
As the name implies, the Data Monitoring team 

02:02.807 --> 02:06.218
MONITORS the movement data in MiMOSA and iGATOR.

02:06.908 --> 02:11.654
They generate and analyze reports that promote compliance to IOM Standards.

02:12.511 --> 02:15.598
And the airlines invoice settlement team ensures that all of

02:15.658 --> 02:18.478
IOM's booked tickets from Global Airlines Partners 

02:18.687 --> 02:21.297
are paid and settled accordingly.

02:21.625 --> 02:25.570
Together these three teams make up the Movement Systems Support.
