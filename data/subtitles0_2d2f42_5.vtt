00:02.692 --> 00:06.180
At this point, we've already established the relationships between Migrants

00:06.270 --> 00:09.547
IOM Operations Personnel, and Airlines Partners. 

00:10.199 --> 00:11.932
So where does MSS fit in?

00:13.272 --> 00:15.272
As previously shown, Ops Personnel 

00:15.527 --> 00:18.615
use MiMOSA, the RMM Portal, and iGATOR. 

00:19.208 --> 00:21.666
As is the case, this is where the Systems Support Team

00:21.821 --> 00:23.115
comes into the picture.

00:23.850 --> 00:26.461
The systems support team manages all of IOM's user 

00:26.560 --> 00:30.144
accesses to these systems, and whenever there are access-related issues,

00:30.337 --> 00:33.958
the system support team is able to provide assistance to resolve the issues.

00:34.631 --> 00:38.634
The Systems Support Team also makes sure to keep the RMM Portal updated 

00:38.711 --> 00:42.581
so that all users will have access to the most updated information in the Portal.

00:44.098 --> 00:46.269
We've previously explained that tickets are booked 

00:46.440 --> 00:48.440
from and issued by the Airlines Partners.

00:49.209 --> 00:51.743
Now we'll see the financial aspect of this transaction.

00:52.166 --> 00:54.566
While the Operations Personnel receives the ticket,

00:54.740 --> 00:56.740
the Airlines Partner simultaneously sends

00:56.806 --> 01:00.275
an Invoice to the Airlines Invoice Settlement team or AIS.

01:00.658 --> 01:05.004
Once the invoice has been checked, verified, and processed,

01:05.341 --> 01:07.685
payment for the Airline Services can proceed.

01:08.842 --> 01:12.960
A more detailed look on the invoicing process will be done later in this presentation.

01:13.491 --> 01:15.891
And lastly, when the Migrants have departed,

01:16.163 --> 01:18.602
we already understand that the iGATOR Ticket Order Record,

01:18.719 --> 01:20.376
must be updated to "USED".

01:21.056 --> 01:24.010
This is where the Data Monitoring Section comes into the picture.

01:24.788 --> 01:27.493
The Data Monitoring Section, or DMS,

01:27.744 --> 01:29.744
monitors iGATOR to make sure that the Ticket Status

01:30.077 --> 01:32.077
of TORs are updated on a timely manner.

01:32.729 --> 01:35.759
DMS sends out reports and reminders to all Missions in case 

01:35.876 --> 01:39.459
there are TORs where the ticket status has not been updated accordingly.

01:40.111 --> 01:44.457
We will also look into these reports in more detail, later in this presentation.

01:46.427 --> 01:48.866
Here's an overview of what the process looks like.

01:49.148 --> 01:51.358
Don't worry if this appears complicated 

01:51.418 --> 01:54.791
as we'll discuss the specific MSS processes in the next topics.
