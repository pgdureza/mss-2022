00:02.174 --> 00:06.349
This time, let's consider the point of view of the Operations Personnel.



00:07.006 --> 00:11.047
When the OPs Personnel enters all the necessary information in iGATOR,

00:11.174 --> 00:14.337
a Ticket Order, or TOR, is created accordingly. 

00:14.863 --> 00:20.239
This TOR contains Proflight, Passenger, Itinerary, and Fare details.

00:20.947 --> 00:24.397
What's interesting is that at the same time the TOR is created,

00:24.412 --> 00:27.785
automatically, a Purchase Order is also created.

00:28.384 --> 00:32.100
It is very important to understand that the information contained

00:32.204 --> 00:36.245
within the TOR is exactly the same as the information created under the PO.

00:36.868 --> 00:39.154
This purchase order will then immediately

00:39.290 --> 00:42.225
 and automatically go into the records of PRISM.

00:42.917 --> 00:47.301
So going back to AIS, now that they have the Purchase Order document,

00:47.434 --> 00:49.243
they can go ahead and check the invoice 

00:49.379 --> 00:51.379
and make sure all the information is in order.

00:52.169 --> 00:55.886
And once everything has been verified and processed in the system, 

00:55.930 --> 00:59.227
AIS will send a request to the Treasury Department. 

00:59.704 --> 01:03.933
After which, the treasury department releases the transfer of payment 

01:03.933 --> 01:06.693
to the corresponding Airlines Partners. 

01:06.846 --> 01:10.071
What this means is that the transfer of money from IOM 

01:10.071 --> 01:14.360
to the Airlines Partners is done by Treasury and not by AIS. 

01:14.993 --> 01:18.314
With the Airlines Partners reimbursed for their services,

01:18.314 --> 01:21.267
this effectively ends the invoicing process.
